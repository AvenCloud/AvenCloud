Stripe is our payment platform that we use to securely accept money.

Thanks to their latest products, the billing code for [Aven Insiders](/insiders-edition) is minimal. We're using [stripe checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription) and the [customer portal](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal).

Let me know if you'd like more details on our Stripe integration.
