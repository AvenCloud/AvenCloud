## Intro to React

React allows you to define your app with components that are composed inside each other.

Components are usually delcared as functions:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, World!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```


## JSX

If you're familiar with JS but are new to React, you might be confused by the HTML tags in the JS code.

This is a language extension called JSX, and it allows you to mix and match Javascript and JSX elements, which describe the structure of your components.

The curly braces allow you to use any Javascript:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  let a = 'Hello'
  if (false) {
    a = 'Goodbye'
  }
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{a}, World!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

When you put JSX elements inside of eachother, you are describing "children" of that component. In the above example, the Text is the child of the View. Other components may have no children, and they do not need a closing tag:

``` js
<Image style={styles.img} />
```

This Image tag also demonstrates a "prop" called `style`. Inside the curly braces we have regular JS, so we look up the `img` key of the `styles` object. The `children` is a special prop.


## Component Props

You can declare a component with inputs, called "props". They are passed in to your function as an object.

```jsx
function Title(props) {
  return <Text style={{ color: props.color }}>Hello, World</Text>;
}
```

The component would be used like this: `<Title color="blue" />`. Here you can see the special "children" prop in action:

```jsx
function Title({ color, children }) {
  return <Text style={{ color }}>{children}</Text>;
}
```

## React Native Components

A few core components are provided by React Native:

### View, Text

See the [View docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) for the props and [styles](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props) of Views, the generic "box" component in RN.

See the [Text docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) for the [styles](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props) and props of Text components.

### ScrollView

See the [ScrollView docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview) for the props and [styles](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props) of scroll views.


### Image

With React Native tools, you can require images directly:

```jsx
<Image
  source={require('./myImage.png')}
/>
```

See the [Image docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image) for the props and styles of image components.


### StyleSheet

You can add styles to your component a few different ways. Usually they are declared statically using the `StyleSheet` utility:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <View style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  app: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  },
});
```

You can also specify styles inline, but this is only reccomended for styles that change based on props or hooks:

```jsx
<View style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
```

You can also combine static and dynamic styles using an array:

```jsx
function Box({ backgroundColor }) {
  return (
    <View
      style={[
        styles.box,
        { backgroundColor }
      ]}
    />
  )
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});
```

### TextInput

See the [TextInput docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput) for the props and styles of text inputs.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, TextInput } from "react-native";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TextInput
      style={styles.textInput}
      value={""}
      onChangeText={(value) => {
        // do something with value
      }}
    />
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  textInput: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: "#aaa",
    borderRadius: 6,
    minWidth: 200,
    padding: 6,
  },
});
```
