# Internet

The worldwide network of computers that speak the TCP/IP protocol to eachother.

# Web

The popular web-browser application speaks the [HTTP](/http) protocol (which is based on [TCP/IP](/tcpip)) to query for web pages and files from a HTTP (web) server.

# Web Server - "Back End"

A "Server" often refers to a number of things:

- The actual computer which is constantly connected to the internet
- The Operating System (OS) that runs programs
  - May have its own dedicated computer hardware
  - May be a Virtual Private Server (VPS) which is a private OS on shared hardware
- A Web Server is an application which speaks HTTP to provide pages to web browsers

The "back end", or "server side" of the web includes the server infrastructure and the application

# Web Browser - "Front End"

A web browser is an application which runs on the computer of each client, connects to the web over http, and uses open source technologies to display web site and apps. The web browser is considered the "front-end" of the web stack.

- Chrome
- Firefox
