# Internet

The worldwide network of computers that speak the TCP/IP protocol to eachother.

# Web

The popular web-browser application speaks the HTTP protocol (which is based on TCP/IP) to query for web pages and files from a HTTP (web) server.

# Web Server

A "Server" often refers to a number of things:

- The actual computer which is constantly connected to the internet
- The Operating System (OS) that runs programs
  - May have its own dedicated computer hardware
  - May be a Virtual Private Server (VPS) which is a private OS on shared hardware
- A Web Server is an application which speaks HTTP to provide pages to web browsers

The "back end" of the web includes the server infrastructure and the application
