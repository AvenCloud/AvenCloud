Aven uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it provides a powerful system for building and rendering a React website, while still giving control to the developer.

Under the hood, Next.js uses [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) to perform many development and building tasks. WebPack is notoriously difficult to configure, so fortunately Next.js manages this üòÅ.

This page describes some great features provided by Next.js

## File-Based Routing

Inside the `pages` directory of our code is all of the URLs that are publicly accessable on the site.

There are wildcard urls such as the comment page at `pages/[pageId]/comment.tsx`, such that any pageId can have a comment page. The comment page can then access the pageId from the nextjs router.

```
// import { useRouter } from "next/router";

// Inside your page:
  const router = useRouter();
  const { pageId } = router.query;
```

## Supporting Live Reloads

In development mode, your site automatically changes when you change your code, thanks to Nextjs (and Webpack under the hood).

## Links

Nextjs has a link component that is smarter than the HTML "<a>" tag you would traditionally use.

When you use the Link component from next.js, it will transition to the page in javascript for a faster user experience. But if the user clicks before the app has loaded, the link works normally.


## MDX

We use next-mdx-enhanced to configure the front-matter of our MDX content.

## TypeScript Support

Coming soon.
