Aven uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it provides a powerful system for building and rendering a React website, while still giving control to the developer.

Under the hood, Next.js uses [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) to perform many development and building tasks. WebPack is notoriously difficult to configure, so fortunately Next.js manages this üòÅ.

This page describes some great features provided by Next.js
