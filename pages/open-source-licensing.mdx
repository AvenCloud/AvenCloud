The open source community is divided into a few camps, with different legal approaches to open source.

## Inclusive "Open Source Software"

The term "Open Source" is managed by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/), and is inclusive of all the license we consider "Open Source", including the common liberal licenses like MIT and Apache2.0, as well as Free Software licenses like GPL and AGPL

### Liberal Open Source: MIT, BSD, Apache

These licenses are "liberal" because they are the most permissive licenses in common use. It is legal for any company to privately change the software and then sell it as their own proprietary product.

Licenses such as [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) are very terse but imply a grant of complete freedom to the user.

The [Apache2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license is published by the Apache Foundation. There are two big benefits that Apache2 offers to project owners:

- It clearly grants users accesss to patents, resolving ambiguity left in the MIT and BSD licenses
- Naming rights are explicitly protected. If users make changes and distribute them, they must rename the project

### "Free Software" and Copyleft

The [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) provides the [GPL "GNU Public License"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) family of licenses.

They offer a feature called ["copyleft"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), which requires modifications of the original software to be open sourced at the time they are sold or redistributed.

This results in a more open project, but there is less corporate uptake, which risks the health of the project.

## Copyright to Content

Although copyright laws apply to both software and text writing, content has always been licensed differently than software. I've always found that confusing!

## Why Aven Choose Apache2 and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

I want to grant the community complete freedom over the _software_ in this repository. Apache2.0 is a great fit for the software license because it allows liberal access to the source code for any purpose, including commercial.

For the _content_ in this repo, I want to grant widespread distribution to support my mission of educating the world on software. But in order to sustain, I need to retain the ability to monetize this content. This is why the Aven content license enforces attribution, and restricts commercial usage. See the explainer here: [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
