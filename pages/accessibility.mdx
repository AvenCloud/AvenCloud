The web has a number of features to assist people with disabilities. It is essential you do your best to implement all of these, to avoid accidentally excluding your customers.

## Scalability

The browser has the ability to scale text up and down, usually with the keyboard shortcuts `cmd +` and `cmd -`. This is critical for visually impaired readers who require larger fonts.

## Light/dark mode

## Keyboard Navigation

A number of accessable input devices lack a pointer, so it is important that the entire site can be controlled with a keyboard.

## Screen Readers

Technology that reads the screen out loud for the visually impaired.

Screen readers can be supported with semantic HTML as well as `aria-` tags.

## Closed Captions

This feature allows hearing-impaired people to read spoken text in videos.
