## The language

CSS is a language for the web that allows you to declare style rules for your HTML elements.

## Special Selectors

Hover, Focused

## Media Queries

Special rules that allow you to declare different styles based on screen size or display type. 

The most common pattern is to specify optimized styles for smartphones and tablet-sized screens.

As another example, you can specify different style rules when something is printed.

## CSS in JS

We're using Emotion to write CSS in-line with our React components

## The complex parts - (Hope you can ignore these!)

### How CSS is loaded

In a web browser, there are 3 ways of loading styles:

- Link external CSS file
- CSS Tag
- Inline style attribute

### Selector Types

Tag type, ID, class, attribute

### Selector Specificity

Ooh my..
