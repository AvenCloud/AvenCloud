a mini-course on building a React Native App.

The course assumes you are comfortable with JavaScript and/or TypeScript, and a familiarity with React will come in handy.

We will build an app called "Violet", which provides local and up-to-date reporting on air quality.

Soon you'll be able to build apps for your phone, from any computer. Better yet- you will be ready to build for both mobile platforms, desktops, and the web!
