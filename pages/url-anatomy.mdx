summary: 'Anatomy of a URL, the protocol, host, path, and query'
---

A full url on the web takes the following format:

`protocol://host:port/path?query#fragment`

Only the protocol and host are mandatory, so you may also see formats such as:

`protocol://host/`
`protocol://host/path?query#fragment`

# Protocol

In web browsers, usually http for unsecured web page, and https for web sites secured with ssl certificates.

# Host

The domain name of the server you're connecting to.

May also be an IP address, in case your server does not have a domain name.

# Port

Override the port that is being looked at on the server. By default, this is port 80 for http, and port 443 for https.

# Path

Generally the path refers to the location of the file you are browsing to, such as an html file. The default path is `/`

When the path refers to a folder, the file that gets sent is the `index` file in that directory, such as `index.html` 

# Query

`?key=1&value=2`

The query is the part of the URL after the `?`, and it usually contains parameters about how the page should be viewed. Each parameter takes the format `param=value`, and they are seperated with `&` characters.

# Document Fragment

The last part of the URL is special because the browser does not send this value to the server. It is usually used to jump to a part of the page.


# Absolute and relative URLs

An absolute URL is one which contains the host, while relative URLs may leave out the host or even part of the path.

Example1. `/about` refers to the "/about" path on the current domain and protocol.

Example2. `details` refers to the relative path. On the `/account` page, it would link to `/account/details`
