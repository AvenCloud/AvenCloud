We will follow [Expo's guide](https://docs.expo.io/distribution/building-standalone-apps/) for building the app for our phone and app stores.

### Configure App


```json:app.json
 {
   "expo": {
    "name": "Violet App Name",
    "icon": "./VioletIcon.png",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "slug": "violet",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.taskreactor.violet",
      "buildNumber": "1.0.0"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.taskreactor.violet",
      "versionCode": 1
    }
   }
 }
 ```

The easiest way to build the app for your phone:

`expo build:android -t apk`


### Android Play Store

When you are ready to build for the Play store, you can build the app bundle:

`expo build:android -t app-bundle`

This bundle can be uploaded to the Google Play store for Android distribution.

### iOS

You can build the iOS app with the following command, and Expo will produce an `.ipa` file that you can upload to apple for test and distribution.

 `expo build:ios`


Now you have some ways of getting your app on the phone and out into the world!
