summary: "Run the Aven test site on your computer"
---

## Basic Setup

Make sure you have NodeJS 12 or 14, and Yarn.

To run Aven Sky (this site) we are going to:

- Check out the repo: https://github.com/avencloud/sky
- Install Dependencies
- Start the app
- Open the app in our web browser

```
git clone git@github.com:AvenCloud/sky.git
cd sky
yarn
yarn start
```

## Full Site Setup

To test the full-blown site on your computer, you will need docker to host an instance of PostgreSQL, as well as credentials to SendGrid and Stripe.

If any of these things are missing, we should fall back elegantly (although, this is a work in progress).
