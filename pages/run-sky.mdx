summary: "Run the Aven test site on your computer"

## Basic Setup

Make sure you have Docker, NodeJS 12 or 14, and Yarn.

To run Aven Sky (this site) we are going to:

- Check out the repo: https://github.com/avencloud/sky
- Install Dependencies
- Start the app

```
git clone git@github.com:AvenCloud/sky.git
cd sky
yarn
yarn start
```

When the server starts in `yarn start`, it will automatically set up your Postgres database in docker, then it will run a migration with Prisma migrate to make sure your database schema is up to date.

> Note: Sometimes the Postgres server does not start fast enough and there is an error on the migration. If this happens, you can re-start the server and the database should be ready


```
> Ready on http://localhost:3001
```

Once you see this message, you are ready to open the app in your web browser at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Full Site Setup

To test the full-blown site on your computer, you will need credentials to [SendGrid](/sendgrid) and [Stripe](/stripe).

If any of these things are missing, we should fall back elegantly (although, this is a work in progress).
