### Code of Condcut

Content on this site may be deleted without warning if it breaks our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

Please report any CoC violations to [conduct@aven.io](mailto:conduct@aven.io).

### License - Repository Source Code

The code of the [Aven Sky](/sky-site) [repository](https://github.com/avencloud/sky) is [open sourced](/open-source-licensing) under the Apache2.0 license, and is Copyright of Aven LLC.

All community contributions are jointly Copyright between the contributor and Aven LLC. This allows Aven to re-license the project in the future, if necessary.

In the rare event that Apache2.0 poses problems to our community, we may change licenses. In that case, we will notify all contributors via email. Even if we do decide to relicense in the future, all your work until that point will continue to be available under Apache 2.0.

### License - Repository Content

Content (the assets and MDX files) in the repo is Copyright of Aven LLC and is licensed under [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). This allows the community to freely remix and re-publish the content under the following conditions:

- No commercial use
- You provide attribution and a link back to aven.io
- Your remix has a [compatible license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-considerations/compatible-licenses)

If you want to license the content for commercial use, or if you cannot meet the other terms, please get in touch with [enterprise@aven.io](mailto:enterprise@aven.io) to discuss your licensing needs.

Like the source code, all community contributions are jointly Copyright between the contributor and Aven LLC. This allows Aven to use the content for commercial use.

### License - Site Content

While you retain a copyright to your work, when you comment on [aven.io](https://aven.io), your content is licensed under [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This is the "site content license"

If you comment on a paywalled page of the site, you grant the site content license to the community, but not everyone will see it. Aven may keep your comment behind the paywall because the site content license allows commercial use. Eventually if the page is made public, your comment will also become publicly accessible.

### Privacy

We provide this [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) to explain the data we collect, and how it is used.

### Contact

To reach us with any legal questions, email [admin@aven.io](mailto:admin@aven.io).

### Changes

These terms may change occasionally, and we will notify users via email if they change in intent. You can [see the change log here](https://github.com/AvenCloud/sky/commits/main/pages/terms-conditions.mdx)
