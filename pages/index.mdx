### The Mission

Our mission is to make it dramatically easier to build custom apps on the web and your phone.


### Why

When more people are able to build custom applications for their businesses and for their life, the more freedom we have from large companies.

With big tech companies in control, our private data gets sold, services get shut down, we get trapped on platforms, we get censored and extorted. Somebody needs to fight for our right to use technology to improve our lives, rather than letting the technology use us.


### Who

Aven is currently focused on serving creators who are familiar with TypeScript and React.

Eventually, to include more people, we will provide an introduction to coding with TS+React.

We may also develop open-source "no-code" tools, to enable non-technical people to create for the web.


### How

Most web development tools suffer from a lack of cohesion. They handle one thing well- but there are very few complete systems that are easy to set up. Aven Cloud is a complete system for building web apps. By encapsulating several popular development tools, it will enable you create and deploy your application in half the time.

Simlarly, there is a lot of education available for any given software topic, but there are few educators who provide a complete story for developing, deploying, and maintaining apps. [This education site](/sky-site) aims to double the onboarding speed for new developers by focusing on breadth and not depth, and by focusing on one technology stack.

If we multiply the effects of simplifying the software 2x, and improving the education 2x, Aven will make it 75% easier to build for the web.
