What if you want to know your computer's current IP address?

## Check your network settings

Usually the most foolproof way to check your computer's IP.

## Command Line - Linux or macOS

Run this command and then squint at the output until you see something that looks like your IP: (I should explain better here, but this is how I do it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

```
ifconfig
```

### Ubuntu

I think ubuntu has changed it to `ip address`

## WAN

Note: Your WAN address may be different. This is how you find your computer's LAN IP address.

To check your WAN address you can use a simple service which echos back your IP, such as [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/).

From the command line you can use curl to ask a similar service for your IP:

```
curl ifconfig.me
```
