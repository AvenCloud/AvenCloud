The framework is currently a collection of tools that work well together for building web apps. Eventually, for the public development of [Aven Sky](/sky-site), we will write more glue code and supporting framework code to simplify your the project.

See the [Aven Stack](/aven-stack) for details on the tech that the Cloud Framework builds upon, including Next.js and Prisma.
