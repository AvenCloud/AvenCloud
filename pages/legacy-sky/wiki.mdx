The term "wiki" is of course derived from [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org). It means "a bunch of community-editable pages that link together".

Because this site (aka [Aven Sky](/sky-site)) is [open source](/open-source), it certainly counts as a wiki!

To contribute, modify one of the .mdx files in the [pages directory](https://github.com/AvenCloud/sky/tree/main/pages) inside of our [github repository](https://github.com/avencloud/sky), and send in a pull request!
