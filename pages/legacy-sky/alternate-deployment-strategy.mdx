summary: "Aside from the VPS strategy, how else are web apps typically deployed?"

Aside from setting up our own server, there are more modern ways of deploying our app, with various tradeoffs.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Heroku has offered the easiest-to use PaaS for years. You give it an application, set up a database, and Heroku will automatically add more instances of your application as needed.

The modern PaaS example is Vercel.

## Serverless

Like PaaS, but you only provide simple functions to the service that will act as an API endpoint. Very simple, but there is no open standard so each serverless service has it's own quirks.

Serverless applications do not have any persistent memory, so you are required to use a database service, and a Redis service if you want a fast cache.

Serverless generally scales up and down very well, in comparison to our current VPS approach.

## Kubernetes

A complicated and powerful system for deploying docker containers on a fleet of machines.

It would be great to ultimately use K8S under the hood of Aven Cloud, because it meets the criteria of industry adoption and robustness. But at the moment, it is too much complexity for us to handle.
