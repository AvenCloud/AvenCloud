### How we choose technology

This is an important topic with more to come, but it must be addressed because developers often become very territorial over their tech stack.

Inevitably, some people will be offended by the choices in the Aven tech stack. This is ok, as long as we have a values-driven methodology of choosing technology, and a mechanism for evolution when we hear community feedback.

- We choose technology that meets [our values](/values)
- Coming soon: Link to new tech evolution page


### App Framework Dependencies

The [Aven Cloud framework](/cloud-framework) and the [Sky site](/sky-site) depend on:

- NodeJS 12 or 14

- Emotion

We use a variety of other small dependencies in Aven Sky, including: jwt-simple, fs-extra, cookie-parser, body-parser, bcrypt, pojo-maps, @expo/spawn-async, remark plugins: autolink-headings, slug
