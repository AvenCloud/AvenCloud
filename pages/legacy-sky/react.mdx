summary: "Why and how does Aven use React?"
---

React allows us to create components, which encapsulate blocks of user interface and application logic.

Thanks to React we write our components as JSX, which provides a HTML-looking feature within JavaScript or TypeScript.

Aven uses React because it allows us to share components between the client, server, native mobile apps. Another key component is [next.js](/nextjs), which manages the setup of your React code on the client and server.

### Example Component

A simple "title" component in `components/Title.js` may look like this:

```jsx
function Title({ text }) {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>
}
```

Here you can see that it will render a h1 tag. You can also see that an object of props is passed into the function, and this component gets a `text` prop.

To use this component in your app or `.mdx` files, you also use JSX:

```jsx
import Title from '../components/Title';

// inside MDX or some other component:

<Title text="Hello, React!" />
```

Check GitHub to see [the components in use by this site](https://github.com/AvenCloud/sky/tree/main/components).
