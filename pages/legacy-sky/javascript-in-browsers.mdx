How does the web browser know what [JavaScript](/javascript) to run? The [HTML](/html) specifies it!

## Loading Methods

### Inline script tags

Your html can inject JS inline by using the script tag:

```html
<script>
console.log('We can write any JS in here!');
</script>
```

### Linked script documents

Your script tag can also specify a `src` url of where to load the JS file:

```html
<script src="https://myweb.site/app.js"></script>
```

### Code loaded through code

There are at least two ways for your app to load additional JS files.

- Create a script tag and add it to the head, so the browser loads it normally
- eval

## Web Workers

Web workers allow you to run an extra instance of javascript in addition to the main application. This is often useful for speeding up complex applications.

Aven doesn't currently use web workers, but with your encouragement we can adopt them and take our apps to the next level.
