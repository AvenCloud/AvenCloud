The word "server" is confusing because it may refer to so many things. Here we give a summary of the different types of "servers":

- Hardware: A physical computer, usually connected to the internet
- Operating System: The independent operating system that runs, (several may share the same physical hardware)
- Application: The actual program that talks to other computers over the internet
- More: Sometimes a "server" is just a concept within an application, such as Discord
