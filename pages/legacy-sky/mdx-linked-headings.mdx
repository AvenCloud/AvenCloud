By default when you use MDX, there are no `id=""` attributes assigned to your html elements. This means there is no way to link to a specific portion on the page with [document links](/document-links).

### Title Linking

The best trick has been on display by GitHub for years. Take the text from headings and convert them to document links.

For example, if you have a gist on github with the markdown heading `## Example Code`, github will render it as `<h2 id="example-code">Example Code</h2>` so that the section can be directly linked to when the url ends with `#example-code`.

## remark-autolink-headings

While setting up aven.io, I spent days trying to figure out why `remark-autolink-headings` did not work when I installed it. Finally I realized it depends on `remark-slug`!


### How to install title linking with Next.js

```bash
yarn add remark-autolink-headings remark-slug
```

In your `next.config.js`, add the following:

```jsx
const remarkPlugins = [
  require("remark-autolink-headings"),
  require("remark-slug"),
];
```

And use it within your `withMdx` or `withMdxEnhanced`:

```jsx
module.exports = withMdxEnhanced({
  ...
  remarkPlugins,
});
```

See the [`next.config.js`](https://github.com/AvenCloud/sky/blob/main/next.config.js) for this site.


Finally restart your server and you can use title links to deep-link to certain content on your page.
