"HyperText Markup Language" is the text-based code that the web browser reads in order to display a web page. It includes the text content on the page, and provides links to all of the javascript, css, images, and videos that the browser should load.

# General Structure

A `.html` document generally has the following format:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- HTML head contents -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- HTML body contents -->
  </body>
</html>
```

The first line is the doctype, which signifies the modern HTML format

The contents of the `<head>` tag are for configuration of the page, while the `<body>` tag is the container for all elements you will see on screen.

You can see the comments in HTML use `<!-- this syntax -->`.
