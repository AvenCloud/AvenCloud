This website presents one way of building, but you might ask- "does it scale"?

The short answer is "I don't know right now", and "probably not". I will tackle this issue when we get to it, or if the community requests this content.

The good news: we have chosen technologies that have all proven to scale well. So I am confident that this site is scalable without having to rebuild it, even though we haven't accomplished that yet.
