summary: "Our upcoming web development ecosystem"
---


Aven Cloud is a web development ecosystem built on top of popular and robust tools.


### Cloud Framework

See the [Aven Stack](/aven-stack) for details on the underlying tech that Aven Cloud apps use, including Next.js and Prisma.

The [Cloud Framework](/cloud-framework) will eventually offer a higher level of integration between the tools in the Aven Stack.

### Cloud Manager

The upcoming [cloud manager](/cloud-manager) app will help you create and run a web application on your PC or Mac.

#### Self-Hosted Deployment

The Cloud Manager will provide a UI to set up and maintain your site on a Digital Ocean [VPS](/vps-providers#what-does-aven-use), which will cost as little as $5/month (plus the cost of your domain).

### Hosted

Eventually Aven will offer [Aven Pro](/pro), a hosted version of Aven Cloud, so you won't worry about server management or uptime.
