This protocol uses SSL to provide a secure HTTP protocol for web servers and browsers.

Basically, `SSL + HTTP = HTTPS`

## SSL Certificate

To verify the identity of a web site, a HTTP server provides a certificate to the client.

### Certificate Chain

Your browser has a few "root" certificates installed. These are used by various agencies to create more certificates that your browser will then trust.

## Lets Encrypt

Historically you had to purchase a SSL Certificate, but the easiest solution these days is to use [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get a free certificate that is trusted by all major browsers.
