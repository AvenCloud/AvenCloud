Aside from setting up our own server, there are more modern (and complicated) ways of deploying our app.

## PaaS

Heroku has offered the easiest-to use PaaS for years. You give it an application, set up a database, and Heroku will automatically add more instances of your application as needed.

## Serverless

Like PaaS, but you only provide a function to the service.

## Docker and Kubernetes

Complicated, but may be worth it.
