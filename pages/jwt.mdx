summary: "What is a JWT and how does it power your session?"
---

A session is the information that the server has to keep you logged in. Usually this is held in server memory, a database, or in the case of a JWT, you can give the session to the client.

A JWT is unique because it is securely signed and then given to the client for ve-verification.

## Cookies

A cookie is a convenient mechanism to store the JWT because the client and server both have the ability to rewrite the cookie.

This comes in handy because the server performs the login, and the client can cut off its own access by clearing the cookie.

## How Aven does it

We store a JWT as a cookie when the user logs in, which includes their user ID.
