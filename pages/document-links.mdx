### Hashtag URL

The "document fragment" is the [part of the url](/url-anatomy#document-fragment) that does not get sent to the server. It comes after the hashtag (#) in a URL:

```
https://example.com/path?query=1#DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT
```

### Document Link Behavior

The web browser will automatically jump to the element with the corresponding id attribute, once the page has loaded. For example, try zooming in on your browser and typing in "#unique-feature" at the end of the url on this page, to see what happens.

This behavior works because the corresponding html has the id:

```html
<h3 id="unique-feature">Unique feature</h3>
```

### JS/TS access

Your code can read and write the document url from your app (with `window.location.hash`).

### MDX

This website [uses remark-autolink-headings](/mdx-linked-headings) to automatically create document ids on each heading, allowing you to link to specific sections on a page.

### Unique feature

Because this part of the URL does not get sent to the server, it may be useful for transmitting secrets to your front-end application.
