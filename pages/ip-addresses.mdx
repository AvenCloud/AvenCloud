IP addresses must be used for any computer to talk to another over the internet - [TCP/IP](/tcpip)

# LAN and WAN IP addresses

Your server will get an IP address like `111.22.33.44` on the internet, which is the Wide Area Network (WAN).

Thanks to your (wifi) router, your computer is typically on the Local Area Network (LAN), with a unique IP that is different from everyone else on your local network. The local IP often looks like `192.168.1.47`.

You can [check your IP address on your computer](/check-my-ip) to confirm this.

# IP address types

### IPv4

The most common format for IP addresses is `111.22.33.44`, (each of the four values has a max of 255).

### IPv6

The upcoming but not-as-common IP format is IPv6, with addresses like: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
