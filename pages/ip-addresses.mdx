IP addresses must be used for any computer to talk to another over the internet (TCP/IP)

# LAN and WAN IP addresses

Your server will probably get an IP address on the Wide Access Network (WAN), which is the general internet.

But at home and at work, your wifi connection probably provides a router, which allows many devices to connect to the internet, sharing a single WAN IP address. This means that your computer may access the outside internet, but the internet cannot access your computer directly unless you forward ports to your computer's IP address.

You can check your IP address on your computer to confirm this, and compare the result with the IP address you see on web services like [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/).

# IPv4

The most common format for IP addresses is `111.22.33.44`, (each of the four values has a max of 255).

# IPv6

The upcoming but not-as-common IP format is IPv6, with addresses like: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
