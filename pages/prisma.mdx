## SQL Database

A SQL database has a number of tables with columns and rows, like pages in an Excel spreadsheet. 

The two most popular SQL databases are mysql and postresql. Aven uses PostgreSQL.

## Object Relational Model

Aven uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to help write code against our PostgreSQL database.

ORMs like Prisma offer a feature called "migration", which help you make "schema" changes to the database, so that it has the correct tables and columns for your application.

## Schema File

Your [`schema.prisma`](https://github.com/AvenCloud/sky/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma) declares the structure of your current application. It starts off with some configuration:

```
model EmailValidation {
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  emailTime DateTime @default(now())
  email     String
  secret    String
}
```

## Development Setup

## Migration Workflow

- Change the Schema
- Create the migration
- Run the migration (or restart the app)
- Re-generate TypeScript
- Re-start VSCode

## TypeScript Usage
