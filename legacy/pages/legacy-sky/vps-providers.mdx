A Virtual Private Server is a private instance of an operating system that is connected to the internet for you. Your server is usually on a shared physical machine, but it has certain guaranteed capapbilites such as CPU cores and RAM.

## Big Tech

Generally I find these very difficult to use, but of course the enterprise loves 'em.

- AWS
- Google Cloud
- MS Azure

## Indie Reccomendations

These are my favorite providers because they are affordable, easy to use, with a track record of quality.

- DigitalOcean
- Linode
- OVH

## Most Affordable Reccomendations

In a class of it's own, a great dedicated server provider, and and also the winner of "cheapest VPS"

- Hetzner


## What does Aven use?

Currently we build upon DigitalOcean because they are very easy to use, affordable, and very reliable.


## Will Aven support X?

Yes, the [Aven Stack](/aven-stack) will run on any cloud.

If you want official support for a provider other than DigitalOcean, reach out to [enterprise@aven.io](mailto:enterprise@aven.io) to discuss.
