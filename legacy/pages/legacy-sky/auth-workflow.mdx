Auth design for this site, a work in progress.

## Primary Auth Flow

### Step 1: Collect email or username from user

We look up the user. If the user doesn't exist:

- If provided an email: Move to step 2a.
- If provided a username that doesn't exist: Display error, ask for email

If the user exists, move to step 2b.

### Step 2a: New user email

Create a session for this browser. Session has timestamp, verification token, and unverified email.

We send an email with a login link that includes the session id and verify token.

Once the verify link is clicked, we create a user with a temporary username and the verified email. If, somehow a user already exists with this email, we link the session to the user.

Now the user is logged in and can change their username.

### Step 2b: Existing user auth

If the user has a password set, offer user to log in with email link or password. If email, a link is sent and user goes to 3a. Otherwise they choose 3b.

With no password set on the user, the magic link is sent and they go to step 3a.

### Step 3a: Email'd magic link

If the user clicks on the login link from their email, it associates the session to the user and the user is logged in.

### Step 3b: Password form

Once the user submits their password

## Logout Flow

The client that logs out immediately deletes the token.

Then it requests to the server with the session ID

This is why tokens are distinct from session IDs- the logout server request may be retried if it fails but the token should be deleted immediately


## Logout All

This request to the server will delete all sessions for a user account, and is an important security feature for unauthorized access.

This should also happen when the the password or email is changed. 

## Username Change

A username can be changed by a logged in user 

This should perform a logout all

## Password Change

A logged in user may set or unset their account's password


## Appendix

### Definitions

A user is "logged in" if the session is currently linked to a user account.

We can instantly recognize an email login attempt from a username because of the presence of `@`

### Formats

Username may be 3-22 characters long. It may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. It must start with a letter and it must not end with a dash. There can not be two sequential dashes.

Password may be 8 - 128 characters.
